    "# To-Do List: EDA, Preprocessing, and Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our target is Claim Injury Type**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "   - **1.1 Data Overview**\n",
    "     - Inspect the dataset structure.\n",
    "     - Check for missing values (NAs) in each column. (There are missing values in the target, what's the % of NAs for each column)\n",
    "     - Analyze basic statistics for numerical features (mean, median, min, max, etc.). ( .info and .describe)\n",
    "     - Investigate categorical features (value counts, unique values).\n",
    "     - Identify anomalies and duplicates in the data. (Age being NA is different from being 0 and Zip Code can be either a str or an int)\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **1.2 Correlations and Relationships**\n",
    "     - Compute correlation matrix for numerical features. (Can be done after dealing with categorical variables)\n",
    "     - Identify and analyze feature relationships with target class using plots (e.g., boxplots, violin plots, histograms).\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **1.3 Target Variable Analysis**\n",
    "     - We should do it before and after preprocessing (maybe?).\n",
    "     - Analyze class distribution of the target variable (severely unbalanced).\n",
    "     - Identify potential patterns between features and classes with less data.\n",
    "     - Discuss and visualize how imbalance could affect model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "   - **2.1 Handling Missing Data and Anomalies**\n",
    "     - Treat missing values (e.g., imputation, deletion). (We drop the ones that are in the target)\n",
    "     - Convert variables that have contextual NAs into dummies (C-2 Date and C-3 Date could be NAs because at the time were yet to happen so they can become C-2 Ocurred, 0 or 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **2.2 Feature Engineering**\n",
    "     - **2.2.1 Date Features**\n",
    "       - Convert date features (e.g., `Accident Date`, `C-2 Date`) into meaningful time variables (e.g., days from a reference date).\n",
    "       - For now we are calling the new feature related to date `feature` Days, we should decide a better name.\n",
    "     - **2.2.2 Age**\n",
    "       - Convert birth year into age in years.\n",
    "       - We could group by Age and search for patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **2.3 Categorical Feature Encoding**\n",
    "     - **Nominal Features**\n",
    "       - Apply Frequency Encoding (or Target Encoding, IDK if it is possible) for categorical features with many unique values (e.g., `Carrier Name`).\n",
    "       - (We don't use Label Encoding for these features because it would imply a rank between them)\n",
    "       - (One-Hot-Encoder creates a column for each class, so the dataset becomes a mess)\n",
    "     - **Ordinal Features**\n",
    "       - Apply Label Encoding for features with natural order (e.g., `Claim Injury Type`).\n",
    "       - Ensure correct ordering during the encoding process. (Need to check this)\n",
    "     - **Store Original Values**\n",
    "       - Store encodings and the original values for potential reverse-mapping in future analysis. (Needed for submission)\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **2.4 Feature Scaling**\n",
    "     - Scale Data. (numerical features only)\n",
    "     - Scale train and validation/test datasets separately to avoid data leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## For now we don't need to worry with the steps below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Dealing with Imbalanced Data (GPT suggested this)\n",
    "   - **3.1 Resampling Techniques**\n",
    "     - **Oversampling**: Try SMOTE or ADASYN to oversample minority classes.\n",
    "     - **Undersampling**: Consider random undersampling of the majority class.\n",
    "   - **3.2 Anomaly Detection**\n",
    "     - Consider integrating anomaly detection methods like Isolation Forest for rare events or minority classes.\n",
    "   - **3.3 Class Weights**\n",
    "     - Modify class weights in models to give more importance to underrepresented classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Data Splitting\n",
    "   - **4.1 Train-Validation Split**\n",
    "     - Ensure proper splitting of data into train and validation.\n",
    "     - Use stratified splitting to preserve the class distribution across datasets.\n",
    "     - Use K-fold (and other splitting methods to deal with unbalanced dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Baseline Model Training\n",
    "   - **5.1 Baseline Models**\n",
    "       - Create lists with different feature and parameters.\n",
    "       - Select Baseline Models (e.g., Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, RandomForest)\n",
    "       - Train models iterating through the lists.\n",
    "   - **5.2 Gridsearch**\n",
    "       - After having 1 or 2 models that outperform the other we try to optimise their preformace\n",
    "       - Very time consuming and resource intensive\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Predict Test\n",
    "   - **6.1 Prepare Test**\n",
    "       - Load Test.\n",
    "       - Preprocess and Scale.\n",
    "       - Load final model (saved in a file) and predict target\n",
    "       - Decoded Target (from 0-8 to text)\n",
    "       - Load submission sample and add predicted values\n",
    "       - Profit\n",
    "    \n",
    "## 7. Train a NN\n",
    "   - **7.1 How to NN**\n",
    "       - Neural Networks are something that we will learn little in ML, in the 2º semester we will have Deep Learning that focus in NNs.\n",
    "       - We shouldn't make direct comparisons to the other models\n",
    "       - It can be a little hit or miss and not everyone can run them\n"
